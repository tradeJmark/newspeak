# Newspeak
Newspeak is a programming language with an English-like syntax. Its purpose is to serve as
a learning language before users transition to more general-purpose languages.

Until I get around to writing a real README, feel free to check out the 
[honours thesis](<docs/Newspeak - An English-like Programming Language for Beginners.pdf>) I 
wrote about Newspeak. It's a bit denser than a README would traditionally be, but feel free to 
just skim it. Of particular interest for anyone wanting to try out Newspeak will be the sections
on the language itself and on the interpreter implementation, as well as the appendices outlining
available statements and expressions.
